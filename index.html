    <h1>HI!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Alessio, a computer science student with a passion for Theoretical
      Computer Science, Programming Language Theory and pretty much anything that 
      involves convoluted mathematical stuff. If you want to learn more about my 
      professional background, check out my <a href="docs/cv.pdf">CV (pdf)</a>.

      The best ways to get in touch with me are via email at 
      <code>(Î» x y . x@y) aferrarini01 gmail.com</code> or on

    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <p>
      I obtained my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from the 
      University of Padua in Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹. During my studies, I had the 
      opportunity to study abroad at VU Amsterdam in the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±.

      <h3>MSc thesis</h3>
      <p>
        For my Master's thesis, I developed a generalization of Hoare logic 
        called Abstract Hoare logic, a "semantics first" approach to obtain 
        sound and complete partial correctness/incorrectness reasoning. You 
        can check it out 
        <a href="https://thesis.unipd.it/handle/20.500.12608/68871">here</a>.

      <h3>BSc thesis</h3>
      <p>
        For my Bachelor's thesis, I developed a type system and implemented some 
        optimizations for a programming language used in one of the biggest 
        Italian software development firms. You can check it out 
        <a href="https://thesis.unipd.it/handle/20.500.12608/32783">here</a>. 
        Unfortunately, it's in Italian.

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>
      Not only do I enjoy the theoretical aspects of computer science, but I 
      also enjoy programming, especially functional programming. My favorite 
      programming language by far is Haskell. You can find pretty much 
      everything I've coded on my 
      <a ref="https://github.com/AlecsFerra">GitHub</a>.
